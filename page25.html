</strong><div>
</div><div>I was Seniors Captain in 2004. Prior to joining the Seniors section of Wycombe Heights  Golf  Club  in 2000 I was a club member  and played occasionally at the weekends in club competitions. 
</div><div>I quickly came to realise what a very well organised section the Seniors were with Monday competitions, Wednesday roll ups,  numerous knockout competitions and matches with other clubs.
</div><div>The success of the Seniors was greatly enhanced by the huge contribution made by the 2001 and 2002 captains Brian Humphrey amnd Brian Collins. Much of the paperwork that we use today – the Monday start times, the lists to sign up for matches against othe clubs and the teamsheets for the matches remain virtually unchanged today. My own contribution to this paperwork was to develop the lists on which you sign up for Monday competitions. The original lists asked  members to sign up on a list on the noticeboard. As the lists were up for some time several members would sign up more than once so that when I came to produce the start list thinking there were 75 entries there were probably only 70. By producing a list of members and getting them to tick their names on the list helped. In recent years the Monday competition situation has been further enhanced by the addition of a regular starter in Mike Clarke.
</div><div>A diary was produced for the captain’s use. Each page covered one week and detailed Monday competition format, what notices should be put up and taken down including those for forthcoming matches. This was updated each year by the vice captain before his captaincy year. Much of the detail remained the same with only the dates needing to be changed. We now have a simplified diary which can be purchased by members.
</div><div>Brian Collins devoted many hours to producing a trophy booklet with a photograph of each trophy and details of the donor and format of the competition. This was made available to all members and still is.
</div><div>Brian Humphrey founded the Par 3 Club and became a Burhill employee for a short time.
</div><div>Sadly as I write in 2018 Brian Humphrey, Brian Collins and the 2003 captain Mike Allen have all died within the last year. They will be much missed but their legacy lives on.
</div><div>
</div><div>When I took over as captain we had no committee as such and all the work was done by the Captain and Vice Captain with a Treasurer, Handicap Secretary and the member recruited to be captain after the current vice captain had served his captaincy. My vice captain, Colin Green, was keen to develop a proper committee system with clearly defined jobs for each member and this was fully implemented when he became captain. Having served and Chaired many committees, mostly sporting, over the years I had developed an aversion to committee meetings and  found it quite refreshing to, more or less, do as I wished during my captaincy year but I agree that it is easier to recruit future captains if the workload is shared.
</div><div>Peter Hesford was the roll up organiser when I joined the Seniors. The trophy we now play for in the roll up was originally presented for an invitation pairs competition which ran for 4 years, including during my captaincy, but eventually failed due to lack of support by members.
</div><div>The golf holiday in May 2004 was at The Manor House and Ashbury hotels near Okehampton and was well supported by both Senior and Lady members. The venue has been used many times before and after this date.
</div><div>I enjoyed my year as captain. As vice captain, captain and the following year I played in every club match and the vast majority of those in the years after that. Over the last couple of years due to mobiliy problems I have not played any. I would recommend that members both new and old get themselves involved. They are a most enjoyable part of golf club life.
</div><div>It was customary, at the time I was captain, for the retiring captain not to stay on the committee but after break I did return as handicap secretary for 8 years and saw the development of Handicap Master software from a downloaded program to the internet cloud version which exists today. My predecessors as Handicap Secretary were Ken Westley and  Eric Rowley. Eric was a stalwart member of the whole club since its opening  and was it’s first Chairman. His commemorative bench is located on 10th tee.
